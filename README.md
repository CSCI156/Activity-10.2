1. Create a list of numbers that has a random length that as filled with random numbers.
2. Create a loop that starts at the first element of the list and goes to the second to last element. For each iteration
in the loop, if the element you are at and the next element are out of order swap them, otherwise leave them alone. 
Print the new list.
3. What happens if you put the for loop from part 2 inside of another for loop that runs from 1 to the length of the list?
